# Stone Challenge
CRUD system using python, Flask and HTML.


## Usage
You'll need to download the following libs to run the code:
- pip install flask
- pip instal flask_sqlalchemy

## Steps
After you install the libs, just run the code (python app.py) and go to your localhost to see the project (usually on http://localhost:5000/index). It's called 'Padaria do seu ZÃ©' and is a CRUD system with all the basics functions of this, including the Update and the Delete functions.
